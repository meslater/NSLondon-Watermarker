NSLondon-Watermarker
====================

A photo editing extension which adds 'NSLondon' to your photos and shows how you can tell Photos you understand the adjustment format and can re-apply the change.

This is very inefficient, if you actually build one of these try not to do all the work synchronously when the extension is loaded and then again at the end!

1. Check it out
2. Run it in the simulator
3. Got to Photos
4. Pick a photo and hit 'Edit'
5. Click the (...) button in the top left
6. Click 'More'
7. Turn the extension on.
8. Try it out!
